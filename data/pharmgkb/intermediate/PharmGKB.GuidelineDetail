PA166184613	Intermediate Metabolizer		- IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:start with 50% of the standard dose. Adjustment of the initial dose should be performed based on toxicity (monitoring of the blood counts) and efficacy.\nNote: The percentage of 50% is based on the analogy with TPMT, for which the gene variants have a comparable effect on toxicity to those of NUDT15. A percentage of < 70% was calculated for NUDT15, but there were insufficient data available to calculate the exact percentage.\nNote: Dose adjustment based on the total of 6-TGN metabolites is not possible for these patients, as they develop toxicity within the therapeutic range that applies for patients without gene variants.\n- LEUKAEMIA: start at 50% of the standard mercaptopurine dose, or start with the standard dose and reduce to 50% if side effects necessitate a dose reduction. It is not known whether dose reduction in advance results in the same efficacy as dose reduction based on toxicity. Adjustment of the initial dose should be performed based on toxicity (monitoring of the blood counts) and efficacy. Monitoring should be performed at an increased frequency.\nNote: The percentage of 50% is based on the analogy with TPMT, for which the gene variants have a comparable effect on toxicity to those of NUDT15. A percentage of < 70% was calculated for NUDT15, but there were insufficient data available to calculate the exact percentage.\nNote: Dose adjustment based on the total of 6-TGN metabolites is not possible for these patients, as they develop toxicity within the therapeutic range that applies for patients without gene variants.\nNote: more stringent dose reductions are necessary if the patient is also TPMT IM or TPMT PM.	0	NUDT15	mercaptopurine

If it is not possible to avoid azathioprine and mercaptopurine: use 10% of the standard dose and advise patients to seek medical attention when symptoms of myelosuppression (such as severe sore throat in combination with fever, regular nosebleeds and tendency to bruising) occur. Any adjustment of the initial dose should be guided by toxicity (monitoring of blood counts) and efficacy.\nNote: The percentage of 10% is based on the analogy with TPMT, for which the gene variants have a comparable effect on toxicity to those of NUDT15. A percentage of < 20% was calculated for NUDT15 PM, but there were insufficient data available to calculate the exact percentage.\nNote: Dose adjustment based on the total of 6-TGN metabolites is not possible for these patients, as they develop toxicity within the therapeutic range that applies for patients without gene variants.	1	NUDT15	mercaptopurine

PA166104964	Ultrarapid Metabolizer		Use 1.5 times the standard dose and monitor the effect and side effects of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine to set the maintenance dose. For depression, the therapeutic range is 200-400 ng/mL for the sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine. For anxiety disorders, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is approximately 100 ng/mL, in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine lower than 200 ng/mL. For obsessive compulsive disorder, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is higher than 200 ng/mL, in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine that is as low as possible. If a dose increase is not wanted due to potential cardiotoxic hydroxy metabolites: avoid clomipramine.

PA166104964	Poor Metabolizer		Indication DEPRESSION: use 50% of the standard dose and monitor the effect and side effects or the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine in order to set the maintenance dose. The therapeutic range is 200-400 ng/mL for the sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine. Values higher than 600 ng/mL are considered toxic. Indication ANXIETY DISORDERS or OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER: if side effects occur: use 50% of the standard dose and monitor the effect and side effects or the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine in order to set the maintenance dose. It is not known whether it is possible to reduce the dose to such an extent that the side effects disappear while the effectiveness is retained. Clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine both contribute to the side effects. Only clomipramine contributes to the effectiveness. For anxiety disorders, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is approximately 100 ng/mL, in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine lower than 200 ng/mL. For obsessive compulsive disorder, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is higher than 200 ng/mL, in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine that is as low as possible. A sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine higher than 600 ng/mL is considered toxic, whilst the therapeutic upper limit for depression is 400 ng/mL.

PA166105007	Poor Metabolizer		Avoid tertiary amine use due to potential for sub-optimal response. Consider alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19. TCAs without major CYP2C19 metabolism include the secondary amines nortriptyline and desipramine.\nFor tertiary amines, consider a 50% reduction of the recommended starting dose. Utilize therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments.	1	CYP2C19	clomipramine
PA166104963	Activity Score 0	AS 0	1. Avoid fluorouracil and capecitabine. Tegafur is not an alternative, as this is also metabolised by DPD.\n2. If if is not possible to avoid fluorouracil and capecitabine: determine the residual DPD activity in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and adjust the initial dose accordingly. A patient with 0.5% of the normal DPD activity tolerated 0.8% of the standard dose (150 mg capecitabine every 5 days). A patient with undetectable DPD activity tolerated 0.43% of the standard dose (150 mg capecitabine every 5 days with every third dose skipped).	1	DPYD	capecitabine
PA166104963	Activity Score 1	AS 1	Start with 50% of the standard dose or avoid fluorouracil and capecitabine. Adjustment of the subsequent dose should be guided by toxicity and effectiveness. However, in one study involving 17 patients with gene activity 1, the average dose after titration was 57% of the standard dose. Tegafur is not an alternative, as this is also metabolised by DPD.	1	DPYD	capecitabine
PA166104963	Activity Score 1.5	AS 1.5	Start with 50% of the standard dose or avoid fluorouracil and capecitabine. After starting treatment, the dose should be adjusted based on toxicity and effectiveness. In a study involving 17 patients with genotype 1/2846T, the average dose after titration was 64% of the standard dose. For 51 patients with genotype 1/1236A, the average dose after titration was 74% of the standard dose. Tegafur is not an alternative, as this is also metabolised by DPD.	1	DPYD	capecitabine
