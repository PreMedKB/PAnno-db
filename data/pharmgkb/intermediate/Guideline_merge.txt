CPIC	PA166105008	The CPIC Dosing Guideline update for carbamazepine recommends an alternative drug for carbamazepine-naive patients carrying at least one copy of either HLA-B*15:02 or HLA-A*31:01 due to the association of those alleles with an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

DPWG	PA166184528	The Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association - Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) recommends to avoid clomipramine in CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizer (UM) for Indication OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER or ANXIETY DISORDERS.	CYP2C19	clomipramine	4349	838	CYP2C19 UM	Indication OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER or ANXIETY DISORDERS: avoid clomipramine. Antidepressants that are not metabolised by CYP2C19 - or to a lesser extent - include, for example, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine. If it is not possible to avoid clomipramine: monitor the effect and side effects or the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine. For obsessive compulsive disorder, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is greater than 200 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine that is as low as possible. For anxiety disorders, the therapeutic plasma concentration of clomipramine is approximately 100 ng/mL in combination with a plasma concentration of desmethylclomipramine lower than 200 ng/mL. A sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine exceeding 600 ng/mL is considered toxic. Add a low dose of fluvoxamine if necessary, to inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 and thereby inhibit the conversion of clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine. Indication DEPRESSION: no action required	0	0
