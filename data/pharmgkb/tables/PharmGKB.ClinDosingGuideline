CPIC	The CPIC Dosing Guideline recommendations for dexlansoprazole are based on the similarity in its metabolism and lansoprazole and extrapolated from the first-generation PPIs. The guideline recommends to increase the starting daily dose and to monitor efficacy in CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizer. For CYP2C19 rapid and normal metabolizers in the treatment of H. pylori infection and erosive esophagitis increasing the dose might be considered after initiation with the standard starting daily dose. The recommendations for intermediate and poor metabolizers for chronic therapy (>12 weeks) and efficacy achieved is to consider 50% reduction in daily dose. See full guideline for further details and supporting evidence.	4349	1020	https://pharmgkb.org/guidelineAnnotation/PA166219301
